# OCR

A project that is currently just starting out but is starting to find some traction. Besides just implementing a few beginner methods to help with analzying images that are inputted, I have some working analysis that can determine whether or not it is a specific letter in very specific circumstances. My main method right now is to get it to work in a very controlled enviroment, which will allow me then to expand from a stable base point.  

As of right now, this program can do a couple major things:  
  1. Given a white background and a black typed letter, it can pinpoint and retrieve the exact bounds of the letter.
