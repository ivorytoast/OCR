# OCR

A project with two main steps:
  1. Develop a sub-program that recieves input of a single black character with a white background and output a set of  distinguishing characteristics that identify that character.
  2. Using that information from step 1, find characters in a picture, and determine the correct character. 
  
This project is not designed text encased in a complex background -- rather it is meant to provide an OCR for objects such as receipts and business cards. 

Goal:
  Be able to give it a receipt -- figure out the total amount, and return the total. This can be then used however one wants. For example, they could store the total into a database to keep track of how much they have spent over a period of time.
